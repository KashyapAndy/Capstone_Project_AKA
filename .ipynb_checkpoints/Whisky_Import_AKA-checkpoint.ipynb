It has a bitterness to it that often goes with a malt of this price and to be honest, I find it a bit acidic. A much smother whisky for the price in my opinion is Famous Grouse Mellow Gold. Or Chivas Regal 12 which is often discounted to around ?22.00. Still, it's what you like and to all those that gave this whisky four stars and above, good for you.\\n</td>\n",

       "49  \\nThe first thing I find about Glen Moray Elgin Classic to swallow is the reviews on this site. Don't get me wrong, it's an okay whisky but never a four plus star dram. Maybe I got a poor bottle from a less refined batch but I would never class this whisky as sweet. It has a bitterness to it that often goes with a malt of this price and to be honest, I find it a bit acidic. A much smother whisky for the price in my opinion is Famous Grouse Mellow Gold. Or Chivas Regal 12 which is often discounted to around ?22.00. Still, it's what you like and to all those that gave this whisky four stars and above, good for you.\\n  \n",
